# Perf Test for CoreData, SwiftData and Realm

Comparing the performance characteristics of Realm, SwiftData and CoreData.

Code accompanying the Emerge Tools blog article:
[SwiftData vs Realm: Performance Comparison](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/swiftdata-vs-realm-performance-comparison)
by Jacob Bartlett.

## Issues

- UUID init is superfluous in all but Realm? CD/SQLite can do the primary keys.
- Delete all users could be just a database table drop/recreate?

## Numbers (Simulator)

M2 Mac Mini Pro, Xcode 16 b2, **running in simulator**
Note: Core Data in the simulator seems to be about 40â¨¯ slower than on device!

- SwiftData and CoreData can grow big, e.g. SwiftData >6GB of RAM for the 1m 
  user inserts, or CoreData >2GB of RAM for the "complex" 100k run.
- SwiftData w/ 1m re-running w/ the fixed non-upsert implementation

Summary simple create, in seconds:

| Count     | SwiftData | CoreData | Realm | Lighter |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
|       100 |      0.02 |     0.01 | 0.003 |       - |
|     1,000 |      0.10 |     0.02 |  0.03 |       - |
|    10,000 |      2.02 |     0.62 |  0.07 |       - |
|   100,000 |    165.10 |    58.87 |  0.52 |    7.85 |
| 1,000,000 | (10333.91)|  4749.45 |  5.05 |       - |
| 2,000,000 |         - |        - |  9.74 |       - |

Summary complex create, in seconds:
- the Core Data numbers look odd compared to SwiftData, 
  maybe doing sth wrong here

| Count     | SwiftData | CoreData | Realm |
